        >Arthur is a spirited ten-year old whose parents are away looking for
        work, whose eccentric grandfather has been missing for several years,
        and who lives with his grandmother in a country house that, in two days,
        will be repossessed, torn down, and turned into a block of flats unless
        Arthur's grandfather returns to sign some papers and pay off the family
        debt. Arthur discovers that the key to success lies in his own descent
        into the land of the Minimoys, creatures no larger than a tooth, whom
        his grandfather helped relocate to their garden. Somewhere among them is
        hidden a pile of rubies, too. Can Arthur be of stout heart and save the
        day? Romance beckons as well, and a villain lurks.</image:caption
