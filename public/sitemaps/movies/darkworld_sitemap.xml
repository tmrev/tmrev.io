        >Fallon is a gorgeous twenty-something with just a couple of flaws. For
        starters, she's dead. A close second, she has found herself in a new job
        serving as a soul huntress for an evil overlord. Fallon accepts her new
        role and quickly turns loose on humanity. Her sinister supervisor, Mr.
        Sixx, is greatly impressed. Over confident in his new student, he
        assigns Fallon to a forbidden case -- one that ignites terrible memories
        and turns her against him. Can faith and family survive an onslaught of
        soul-searing demons? What happens when Fallon discovers that her next
        target is someone that she greatly cares for?</image:caption
