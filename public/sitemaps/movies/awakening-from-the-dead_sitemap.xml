        >The story takes place at the beginning of the bombing, both in Belgrade
        and in one small town in Serbia, at the end of March 1999.
        Forty-year-old Mickey, an unaccomplished writer, a disillusioned
        assistant professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts, a discouraged democrat
        and a columnist, dismissed from a famous daily newspaper, emerges from
        his own grave and enters into his own life. Within 48 hours, he will try
        to achieve all those things he couldn't while he was alive. At the same
        time, post-mortem, he will try to save the dignity of his own community
        and his tribe, not taking too much care of himself.</image:caption
