        >A2 is a continuation of director Tatsuya Mori's film A (1998), an
        incredible view inside the compound of Japan's Aum Shinrikyo cult after
        its leaders carried out the deadly sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway
        in 1995. Most followers had no idea that the attacks were being planned,
        or even that their new religion had violent aspirations. After the
        attacks, these followers were left to rebuild the religion where they
        had once found peace in the face of overwhelming, and understandable,
        condemnation from the rest of Japan. Central focus is placed on Hiroshi
        Araki, a young man who finds himself elevated to chief spokesman for Aum
        after its leaders are arrested. Araki faces extreme hostility from the
        Japanese public, who find it hard to believe that most followers of the
        cult had no idea of the attacks and even harder to understand why these
        followers remain devoted to the religion, if not the
        violence.</image:caption
