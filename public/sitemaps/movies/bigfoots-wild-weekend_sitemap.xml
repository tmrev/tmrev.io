        >A tabloid reporter makes a shocking cryptozoological discovery while
        investigating a recent rash of Bigfoot sightings in this comedy
        featuring beer, bikinis, and the wildest party animal you've ever met.
        Harlan James (Chase Carter) doesn't believe in Bigfoot. He's determined
        to disprove his existence when he heads into the woods, and starts to
        interview witnesses. Much to Harlan's surprise, he finds that Bigfoot is
        no forest-dwelling menace, but a mischievous Sasquatch with a taste for
        beer, and a love of beautiful women. Unfortunately for the fun-loving
        creature, vengeful redneck Chester Scroggins (Ron Blackwell) and some
        villainous bounty hunters are more interested in capturing Bigfoot than
        sharing a brew with him. Now, with the clock ticking, Harlan enlists the
        aid of the local sheriff (David Novak) and a pretty television reporter
        (Nicole Parsneau) in getting the story of a lifetime, and protecting the
        beast who only wants to party.</image:caption
