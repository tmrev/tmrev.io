        >In an overcrowded and turbulent town, nighttime is refuge for
        prostitutes, hit men...and anyone else seeking a new start. When Jenny,
        a local hooker, disappears without a trace, the town pimp Armando sets
        out to defend his territory at all costs and find out who's behind the
        mysterious disappearances. All the clues point to Father Mosqueda, the
        conservative and beloved local priest, who preaches a radical new
        philosophy by day and by night prowls the streets -- looking for comfort
        among the women of the night. His mission? To transform mankind in the
        image of a beehive with the same rigid discipline that runs the world of
        the queen bee, drones and worker bees. It doesn't take long before
        Armando suspects Mosqueda of being the one responsible for the missing
        girls. Little does Armando know the dark secret that awaits him at the
        final showdown. Could Father Mosqueda be responsible for the missing
        women?</image:caption
