        >I’m in the South of France. My base? The high-tech testing ground for
        Formula One Circuit Paul Ricard. My mission? To find find my favourite
        car of the year. There's a pair of Ferraris, the V12, 6.3 litre FF and
        the 458. There’s the UK challenger to the 458, McLaren’s MP4-12C. The
        latest gizmo-laden Nissan GTR, Porsche's GT2 RS, the 570-horsepower
        Lamborghini Performante and the fun BMW 1M. Helping me are The Stig and
        Formula One new boy, Karun Chandhok. I look into the future, in the
        shape of the hybrid-engined Mugen Honda CR-Z, And there are blasts from
        the past as well. The beautiful Eagle Speedster a modern twist on the
        iconic, timeless E-Type, with its 4.7 litre engine and an eye-watering
        £500,000 price tag. And there's the all new Jensen Interceptor R with
        its 6.2 litre Corvette motor. The mighty Brutus, a vintage car fitted
        with a flame-spitting BMW airplane engine. Also the single-seater,
        B.A.C. Mono - capable of 0-60 in 2.8 seconds. What more could you
        want?...</image:caption
