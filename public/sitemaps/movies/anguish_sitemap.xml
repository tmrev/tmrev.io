        >A new girl in a quiet town, Tess tries to manage her psychosis while
        adjusting to her new life with her mom. After stumbling upon the shrine
        of Lucy, a hit and run victim, Tess finds herself overwhelmed by
        hallucinations of the dead girl and starts to question her sanity again.
        When the spirit possesses Tess’s mind and soul, mother and daughter are
        at a loss for where to turn next for salvation: religion or medicine?
        Both institutions have failed them to date but faith leads them to the
        house of Sarah, Lucy’s mother, who has been despondent since the
        accident. All together with time working against them, Sarah is
        desperate to believe that Lucy is still alive in Tess but neither parent
        wants to give up on their daughter. Now that she understands what is
        happening to her, ultimately Tess must decide whether she wants to keep
        fighting or succumb to her affliction.</image:caption
