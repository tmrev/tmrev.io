        >Based on the novel of the same name by Le Lu, first published 18 years
        ago, Viet Kieu (overseas Vietnamese) Ho Quang Minh's film is an
        ambitious re-telling of the first part of Le's novel spanning from the
        wars for independence to the Communist era. In this portion, a man named
        Giang Minh Sai (The Quan) is forced to marry Tuyet (Ho Phuong Dung) at
        the age of ten and leaves his home by the river wharf to live with an
        old man named Kien. As the war against France accelerates, Sai enlists
        to fight and falls in love with another woman named Huong. While the
        affair is fated not to last, Tuyet struggles to keep her marriage
        together.</image:caption
