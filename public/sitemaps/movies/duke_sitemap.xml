        >Duke is a modern day telling of a classic western film. Dare and Roost
        are brothers who have been raised in a reformatory, taught to survive
        and conditioned to trust no one. They have moved to West Los Angeles,
        where Dare moonlights himself as a Detective and Roost blankets himself
        in old John Wayne films and reclusive habit. Cleaning the streets and
        ridding the neighborhoods of scum, this contemporary study finds Dare
        obsessed with a phantom like criminal (Winky) who seems to be
        terrorizing the community. Simultaneously, the same exact investigation
        is being led by official and likely engrossed Detective Robert Morrison.
        As Dare closes in on Winky and the entire department closes in on them
        both, these brothers must make the ultimate commitment and pay the
        extraordinary consequences therein.</image:caption
