        >They have always been trouble and now they are in trouble. When three
        generations of the Slaters - Kat, Little Mo, Lynn, Zoe and Mo - go up
        town, it could only really end with a night in a police cell. But
        straight out of the disco, the fiery Slater girls - dressed in school
        uniforms - are far too hot for the local constabulary to handle. With
        time on their hands they have an opportunity to look back on their
        lives; Mo's bust-ups, Lynn's altercations at the altar, Kat's
        confrontation with her past, Little Mo's nightmare with evil Trevor and
        a cauldron of steamy romances. When not flirting with the night
        sergeant, they give the inside story on the Slater highs and lows; the
        passion, the heartbreak, the fights and laughter of a family that
        doesn't know the meaning of the phrase "The quiet life."</image:caption
