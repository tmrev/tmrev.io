        >Ronnie lives in a small sleepy village and is the owner of a small
        company for deep-frozen goods. Daydreams, contact ads, the firemen's
        brassband, the weekly visits at his shrink and his buddy Lars' cynical
        remarks about air guitar and vinyl-records are the highlights of
        Ronnie's life. Already, as a kid, he suffered from being under the
        pressure of his power- and manhood-fixed mother. Ronnie's feelings are
        as deep-frozen as his goods. Until the day, a wonderful being - one of
        the female kind - strands in the village. The local priest hires the
        young girl, a groupie with the name of Zoya, as housekeeper and within
        days, Zoya turns the whole manship of the village mad and horny. Also
        Ronnie falls for Zoya and, well yes, lucky for once, marries her.
        However, since the presence of Zoya, strange things have happened in the
        village. Everybody who tries to search in Zoya's unkown past dies,
        disappears. Slowly that well-known fear sneaks into Ronnie's body: men's
        fear of women.</image:caption
