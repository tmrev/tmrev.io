        >Before leaving to settle abroad, Ahmad accepts one last job. He must
        audition actors for the new National Palestinian Theatre. On the road
        with interviewer Bissan and her cameraman Loumir, Ahmad goes in search
        of talent in the numerous refugee camps of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
        Hopefully for the last time, Ahmad experiences the insurmountable
        difficulties of life in Palestine: harassing searches at check points
        and borders, barricades, constant tension. He realizes the destiny of
        all waiting refugees is much the same as his own. He ends up guiding the
        auditioning actors into dramatizing what best embodies their destiny.
        But with the chance to catch his plane at risk, Ahmad could see the
        opportunity for his long-awaited exile slip away.</image:caption
